## Motivation
With the 2020 Summer Olympic games upcoming, we were interested in analyzing data and making predictions for Tokyo. This was further motivated by a lack of Olympic research, especially prediction, on cursory examination. We were interested in identifying factors that predict medal success on both a country wide and individual basis

## Goals
We attempted to find answers to the following questions:
* How does gender affect medal counts?
* Is GDP predictive of medal success for countries?
* Is there a host country advantage that can be seen in the medal count?
* Does Body Mass Index (BMI) predict medal success? We use the men's 100m dash as a case study.

## Data Munging
Web scraped data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results). GDP data from 2000 to 2018 was taken from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) For consistency in events and other factors, only data post WWII was considered. Further, the data was broken down by Summer and Winter games and analyses run separately.
